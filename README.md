# Project01
This is a simple project using [React.js](https://legacy.reactjs.org/).

In this project, I have implemented the basic UI using [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

In the first page, I have added a contact form. On submitting this form with required data, the data will be saved in Local Storage.

In the Second page I have used a random API, fetched it's data and shown in [Data-Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) and added [Accordion](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/) using [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

I have deployed the project using Netlify,
